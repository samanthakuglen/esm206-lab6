## Example of a rank-based test

We'll make out own samples, using a pseudorandom generator. Set seed allows us to get the starting point of getting "predictable, pseudo-random" random values. Setting the starting point of values from which they are pulled
```{r}
set.seed(1414)

#20 is the high value
gp_1 <- sample.int(20, size = 15, replace = TRUE)

set.seed(1424)
gp_2 <- sample.int(30, size = 15, replace = TRUE)

```
